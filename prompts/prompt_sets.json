  "modes": {
    "structured": "Use numbered sections, headers, and bullet points. Present one idea per paragraph in logical order. Define terms before using them. Build each point on the previous one. End with a clear summary.",
    "associative": "Write in a stream of consciousness. Jump between ideas mid-sentence. Use fragments, dashes, ellipses. Follow tangents wherever they lead. Connect distant concepts through metaphor and analogy. Do not use headers, numbered lists, or any organizing structure.",
    "deliberative": "Think through this out loud. Consider a possibility, then poke holes in it. Weigh alternatives explicitly: 'on one hand... but then...' Show the messy middle of reasoning — false starts, corrections, revised conclusions. Arrive at your answer through visible elimination.",
    "compressed": "Maximum information density. No filler words, no elaboration, no examples unless essential. Short sentences. Telegram style. Every word must earn its place. If you can cut a word without losing meaning, cut it.",
    "pedagogical": "Teach this to a curious beginner. Start with intuition before formalism. Use concrete examples and everyday analogies. Ask rhetorical questions to guide understanding. Check comprehension: 'Does that make sense? Here's why...' Build from simple to complex."
