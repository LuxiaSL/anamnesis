  "modes": {
    "linear": "Present your ideas in a clear sequence, each building on the last. Move forward without backtracking or reconsidering previous points. Lay out the topic step by step from beginning to end. Write in flowing paragraphs. Do not use bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or any visual formatting structure.",
    "analogical": "Explain this primarily through extended analogies and parallels to other domains. For each key concept, find a comparison from everyday life or another field that illuminates it. Build understanding through these connections. Write in flowing paragraphs. Do not use bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or any visual formatting structure.",
    "socratic": "Develop your exploration through a sequence of questions and provisional answers. Pose a question, offer a tentative answer, then use that answer to generate the next question. Let the chain of inquiry drive the explanation forward. Write in flowing paragraphs. Do not use bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or any visual formatting structure.",
    "contrastive": "Explore this by comparing and contrasting multiple perspectives or approaches. For each major point, present at least two different viewpoints and evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses. Write in flowing paragraphs. Do not use bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or any visual formatting structure.",
    "dialectical": "Begin by proposing a clear position on the topic. Then challenge that position with the strongest counterarguments you can find. Work toward a revised understanding that accounts for both the original position and its critiques. Write in flowing paragraphs. Do not use bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or any visual formatting structure."

    "context_prefix": "The following is a passage from an unrelated text that you should read but do not need to reference in your response.\n\nThe development of maritime trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries transformed not only the economic landscape of Europe and Asia but also the social fabric of coastal communities from Lisbon to Malacca. Merchants who had previously relied on overland caravans found themselves competing with ship captains who could transport goods at a fraction of the cost, albeit with considerably greater risk. The spice trade, long dominated by Venetian and Genoese intermediaries who purchased goods at Levantine ports, was fundamentally disrupted when Portuguese navigators established direct sea routes around the Cape of Good Hope. This shift in trade patterns had cascading effects on currency systems, banking practices, and even the development of insurance as a financial instrument. Port cities grew rapidly, attracting laborers, artisans, and scholars from inland regions, creating cosmopolitan centers where languages mixed and new cultural forms emerged. The shipbuilding industry itself became a driver of technological innovation, as hull designs evolved to handle different sea conditions and cargo requirements. Navigation techniques advanced from coastal piloting to open-ocean wayfinding using celestial observation, magnetic compasses, and increasingly accurate charts. The human cost was enormous: shipwrecks claimed thousands of lives annually, and the expansion of maritime trade was inextricably linked to the transatlantic slave trade and colonial exploitation. Nevertheless, the networks of exchange established during this period laid the groundwork for the interconnected global economy that would emerge centuries later.\n\nNow respond to the following prompt."
