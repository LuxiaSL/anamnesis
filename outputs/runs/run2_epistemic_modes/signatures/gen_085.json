Like a warm, crusty loaf emerging from the oven, the story of bread has been unfolding for thousands of years, weaving a rich tapestry of human experience.\n\nIn the earliest days of human civilization, around 10,000 BCE, our ancestors discovered the magic of grinding grains into flour. This serendipitous moment marked the beginning of bread's journey, as it became a staple food, providing sustenance for the body and nourishment for the soul.\n\nThe earliest evidence of bread-making comes from the Fertile Crescent, a region that spans modern-day Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and parts of Turkey and Egypt.
