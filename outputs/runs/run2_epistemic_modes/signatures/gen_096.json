While it's easy to romanticize friendships as effortless and all-consuming, the reality is that building and maintaining a good friendship requires effort, dedication, and a willingness to navigate the ups and downs of life together. But what exactly makes a good friendship?\n\n**Commonalities and Shared Experiences**\n\nOne of the most fundamental aspects of a good friendship is the shared experience of life.
