Instead, you feel a sharp pain in your knee and a sudden jolt of fear. You quickly get up, assess the situation, and decide to take a different route. This is similar to what happens when a program encounters a segfault (segmentation fault). The program crashes, but it doesn't necessarily leave any physical evidence behind.\n\n**What is a Segfault?**\n\nA segfault is a type of runtime error that occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location that it's not allowed to access. This can happen due to various reasons such as:\n\n* A null pointer dereference (trying to access memory through a null pointer)\n* Out-of-bounds array access (accessing an array index that's outside its bounds)\n* Reading or writing to a memory location that's not allocated for the program\n\n**Intuition Before Formalism**\n\nBefore we dive into the formal debugging process, let's think about what we want to achieve. When debugging a segfault, our goal is to identify the source of the error and fix it. We can start by asking ourselves some questions:\n\n* What was the program doing when it crashed?\n* Was it performing any unusual operations?\n* Did it receive any error messages or warnings?\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Error**\n\nWhen a segfault occurs, the program will typically print an error message that indicates the location of the fault. This can be a helpful clue, but it's not always clear what's going on. For example:\n\n`Segmentation fault (core dumped)`\n\nThis message tells us that a segfault occurred, but it doesn't provide any additional information about what caused it.\n\n**Step 2: Gather Information**\n\nTo debug a segfault, we need to gather as much information as possible about the error. This can include:\n\n* The program's output and any error messages\n* The stack trace (a record of the program's function calls)\n* The memory layout of the program\n\nLet's say we're debugging a program that prints a message when it crashes. We can use a debugger like GDB (GNU Debugger) to gather information about the error.\n\n**Step 3: Use a Debugger**\n\nA debugger is a powerful tool that allows us to step through the program's code, examine variables, and examine memory. When we use a debugger, we can:\n\n*",
