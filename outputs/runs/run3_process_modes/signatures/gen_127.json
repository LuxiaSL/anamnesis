  "generated_text": "**Chemical Formula of Water**\n\nThe chemical formula for water is H2O.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nIn chemistry, a chemical formula is a symbolic representation of the composition of a molecule. It consists of symbols, known as elements, that represent the atoms present in the molecule. In the case of water, the formula H2O indicates that one molecule of water consists of:\n\n* 2 hydrogen atoms (denoted by the symbol H)\n* 1 oxygen atom (denoted by the symbol O)\n\nThe subscript numbers (2 and 1) indicate the number of atoms of each element present in the molecule.\n\n**Why H2O?**\n\nThe chemical formula H2O is derived from the Latin words \"hydro\" (water) and \"oxys\" (acid). The \"2\" in H2O represents the two hydrogen atoms, and the \"O\" represents the single oxygen atom. This formula is widely used to represent the composition of water and is recognized globally.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe chemical formula for water is H2O, which represents one molecule of water consisting of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. This formula is a fundamental concept in chemistry and is widely used to represent the composition of water.",
