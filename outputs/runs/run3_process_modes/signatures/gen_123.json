You're eager to ride it, but you're not quite sure where to start. That's exactly what we're going to go through today - the journey of learning to ride a bike!\n\n**Intuition First**\n\nBefore we dive into the formal rules, let's think about how we learn things in life. We don't just follow a set of rules and expect to know how to ride a bike. We start by trying it out, making mistakes, and learning from them. So, let's get on that bike and give it a try!\n\n**Starting Small**\n\nWe'll begin with a simple exercise: balancing on the bike while it's stationary. Can you imagine yourself sitting on the bike, holding onto the handlebars, and just balancing? That's it! You're already riding a bike!\n\n**Getting Moving**\n\nNow that you're comfortable balancing, let's try gliding slowly. Can you push off with one foot and start rolling? Remember, it's okay to wobble a little - that's all part of the learning process. You're getting the hang of it!\n\n**Steering and Stopping**\n\nAs you gain confidence, let's practice steering and stopping. Can you lean the bike to one side to turn? And can you use the brakes to slow down or stop? Remember, it's not just about pushing the pedals - it's about using the whole bike to control your movement.\n\n**Does that make sense? Here's why...**\n\nBy starting with small steps and building up gradually, we're giving ourselves the opportunity to learn and make mistakes without feeling overwhelmed. It's like trying to ride a bike for the first time - we wouldn't start by trying to ride a mountain bike or a unicycle!\n\n**The Power of Practice**\n\nThe more you practice, the more confident you'll become. And that's exactly what we need to do - keep practicing until we feel comfortable and confident on the bike. Remember, every time you fall off (and you will!), it's okay. We can get back on and try again.\n\n**Putting it all Together**\n\nNow that we've practiced balancing, gliding, steering, and stopping, it's time to put it all together. Can you ride the bike from one end of the driveway to the other? That's it! You're riding a bike!\n\n**Tips for Parents**\n\nIf you're a parent, here",
