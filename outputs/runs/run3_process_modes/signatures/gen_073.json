No last element. \nZeno's paradox: if you travel halfway, then halfway again, infinitely, you'll never reach your goal.\n\nInfinity is often represented by the symbol \u221e. \nIn calculus, limits approach infinity. \nAs x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches \u221e.\n\nInfinity is also used in topology. \nThe real line is compact, but not complete. \nInfinity is added to complete the real line.\n\nInfinity is a mind-bending concept. \nIt challenges our understanding of space and time.",
