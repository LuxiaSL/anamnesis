  "generated_text": "Genetic engineering raises concerns over human dignity, equality, and access to resources. \nInheriting traits can exacerbate existing social disparities.\nGene editing tools like CRISPR enable precise modifications, sparking debates on germline editing and non-germline applications.\nDesigner babies and \"designer\" humans challenge traditional notions of identity and humanity.\nRegulatory frameworks are inadequate, leaving uncertainty over safety and long-term consequences.\nPublic engagement and informed consent are crucial, but access to genetic information and resources is unequal.\nGenetic enhancements can blur lines between human and machine, questioning what it means to be human.\nThe ethics of genetic engineering require ongoing discussion and careful consideration of potential risks and benefits.",
