  "generated_text": "**Initial Thought:** I think a good friendship is built on mutual trust, respect, and open communication.\n\n**Poking Holes:** But isn't that a pretty idealistic view? What if my friends and I have different values or interests? How can we truly understand each other?\n\n**Alternative:** Maybe a good friendship is more about shared experiences and inside jokes. That way, we can bond over something that's unique to our friendship, and it can be harder for other friendships to replicate that.\n\n**Revised Thought:** That's true, but doesn't shared experiences also rely on the other person being present and engaged? What if my friends are always busy or distracted? Does that really count as a good friendship?\n\n**Counterpoint:** On the other hand, maybe a good friendship is about having a strong emotional connection. That way, we can be there for each other through thick and thin, and our bond can be incredibly resilient.\n\n**Revision:** But isn't that a bit too intense? I mean, I don't want to be in a friendship that's just a emotional crutch for me. I want to be able to support my friends in their own ways, not just rely on them for emotional support.\n\n**New Angle:** Maybe a good friendship is about having a balance of different types of connections. I need both emotional support and shared experiences to feel like I have a strong, healthy friendship.\n\n**Refining the Idea:** That's it! A good friendship is about having a balance of different types of connections, including emotional support, shared experiences, and mutual respect. It's not just one or the other \u2013 it's about finding that sweet spot where all these elements come together to create a strong, meaningful bond.\n\n**Final Thought:** And I think that's why some friendships can feel so strong and lasting \u2013 because they're not just about one aspect of the relationship, but about the entire web of connections that hold us together.",
