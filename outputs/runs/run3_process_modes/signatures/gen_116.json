Let's start with the basics and build from there.\n\n**Intuition First**\n\nYou know what it's like to learn to ride a bike? It's not just about sitting on a bike and pedaling - it's about feeling the wind in your hair, the sun on your face, and the thrill of movement. Children are naturally curious, and they'll pick up on these feelings quickly if you give them the chance.\n\nImagine you're holding a baby, and they're learning to sit up for the first time. You don't need to tell them how to balance or how to move - you just need to be there, supporting them, and encouraging them to try. It's the same with teaching a child to ride a bike. You need to be present, supportive, and encouraging.\n\n**The First Steps**\n\nBefore we dive into the formal bits, let's think about what we want to achieve. We want the child to feel confident and in control on the bike. We want them to learn how to balance, steer, and stop.\n\nHere's a simple question: What's the first thing we need to do to get the child comfortable on the bike? That's right - we need to get them used to sitting on the bike and feeling stable. We can do this by:\n\n* Holding the saddle and running alongside them\n* Giving them a gentle push to get them started\n* Encouraging them to put one foot on the ground and then the other\n\nAs they get more confident, we can start to let go of the saddle and give them more space to practice.\n\n**Formalism**\n\nNow that we've got the basics covered, let's talk about some formal rules to follow.\n\n* **Safety first**: We need to make sure the child is wearing a helmet and that the bike is in good working condition.\n* **Balance and steering**: We need to teach the child how to balance and steer the bike. This involves leaning the bike to one side and then the other, and using the handlebars to steer.\n* **Stopping**: We need to teach the child how to stop the bike safely. This involves using the brakes and coming to a gentle stop.\n\nBut here's the thing: these formal rules are just guidelines. The most important thing is to make sure the child feels confident and in control.\n\n**Putting it all Together**\n\nSo, how do we put all of this together? Here's an example",
