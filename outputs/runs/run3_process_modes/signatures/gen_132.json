However, I can provide you with general information about the election process and the importance of county-level results.\n\n**Understanding County-Level Elections**\n\nIn the United States, presidential elections are typically won by the candidate who receives the majority of the electoral votes.

Therefore, I am unable to provide specific results for the 2024 election by county in Wisconsin or any other state.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, while I can provide general information about the importance of county-level results in presidential elections, I do not have the specific results of the 2024 United States presidential election by county in Wisconsin. If you are looking for detailed information about the election, I recommend checking with reliable news sources or official election websites for updates.",
