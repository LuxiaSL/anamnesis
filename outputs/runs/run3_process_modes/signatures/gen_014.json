Let's start with a question: What is bread, really?\n\nIs it just a simple food made from flour, water, yeast, and salt? Or is it something more? Something that's connected to our very existence?\n\nLet's start with a little intuition. Think about it - we've been eating bread for thousands of years. It's been a staple food in many cultures around the world. But have you ever wondered how it got there? How did humans first discover the magic of bread?\n\nWell, let's take a journey through time. The earliest evidence of bread-making dates back to around 10,000 BCE, during the Stone Age. At that time, humans were still learning to farm and domesticate plants and animals. But they knew that by grinding grains into flour and mixing it with water, they could create a tasty and filling food.\n\nOne of the earliest forms of bread was flatbread. It was made from crushed grains, water, and sometimes even animal fat or honey. This simple flatbread was a staple food in many ancient civilizations, including the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Greeks.\n\nBut as humans began to domesticate wheat and other grains, bread-making became more sophisticated. They discovered that by adding yeast, they could create a lighter, airier bread that was more palatable. And that's when the magic of bread really began to happen.\n\nLet's talk about yeast. What is yeast, really? It's a tiny microorganism that's found in the air and on surfaces. But when it's combined with sugar and water, it starts to ferment, producing carbon dioxide gas. This reaction makes the dough rise, creating a light, airy texture that we love in bread.\n\nYeast is like a tiny little miracle worker. Without it, bread would be dense and flat. But with yeast, we can create a wide range of breads, from crusty baguettes to fluffy white loaves.\n\nAs bread-making spread across the ancient world, different cultures developed their own unique bread-making traditions. In ancient Egypt, for example, they made a sweet bread called \"ta'ameya\" that was topped with spices and nuts. In ancient Greece, they made a bread called \"barley cake\" that was made with barley flour and honey.\n\nBut bread wasn't just a food - it was also a symbol of community and hospitality.
